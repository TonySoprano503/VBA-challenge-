# VBA-challenge-
challenge 2
I worked with the Instructor during office hours to help me write missing portions in my VBA Solutions
This includes splitting up VBA solution into 6 different subs and to specifying next ws to write on each sheet as the outputs were originally displaying on a seperate sheet vs within each one.
My original solution also exclude specifying the range for Ticker, Value, Greatest increase, decrease, and total volume as I thought the ranges only needed to apply to provided data set columns date, open, high, low, close, and volume.
